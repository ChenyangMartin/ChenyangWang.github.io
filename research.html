        <ul>
            <li>Investor Emotions and Asset Prices in Chinese Stock Market - with Richard Taffler and Vineet Agarwal.</li>
            <p>
            By using the monthly stock data of Chinese stock market from 2005 to 2024, we found that positive investor emotion has economically and statistically meaningful predictive power for stock returns in Chinese stock market:
            <p>
            At the market level, positive emotion significantly predicts higher next-month and cumulative three-month excess market returns, even after controlling for lagged returns, economic policy uncertainty, and aggregate sentiment, while negative emotion exhibits no predictive power.
            <p>
            At the firm level, the return impact of positive emotion is significantly stronger for stocks with higher trading frictions, as proxied by quoted bid–ask spreads.
            <p>
            Finally, at the portfolio level, positive investor emotion predicts a higher subsequent returns of value-weighted (or equal-weighted) long–short portfolio formed on stocks’ ex-ante sensitivity to investor emotion,
            and this predictability persists after controlling for standard asset-pricing factors, macroeconomic uncertainty, aggregate sentiment, and return persistence.
