            <li>Exploring Team Formation Among Chinese Students in the UK: A Theory of Planned Behaviour - with Ralf Becker, Yidi Sun.

              This research explores the self-selection of student groups in a second-year economics module, where 50% of the 20 groups consisted exclusively of Chinese students, nine were solely non-Chinese, and only one was mixed. 
              This highlights a preference for homogeneous group formation, particularly among Chinese students. Using Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine factors influencing these choices, including attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. 
              Preliminary findings suggest language barriers, academic performance concerns, and cultural differences are key drivers. Our research informs universities on fostering inclusive learning environments through intercultural activities and teaching strategies to enhance collaboration.
              
              This research has been presented at the DEE Conference 2025. </li>
